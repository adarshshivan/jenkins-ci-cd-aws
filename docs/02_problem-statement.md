# Problem Statement

In real-world development, teams need reliable CI pipelines to validate code changes before they reach production. While many CI tools exist, choosing the right one depends on factors such as control, cost, maintenance, and scalability.

The main problems addressed in this project were:
- Ensuring consistent builds using Docker
- Running automated tests reliably in CI
- Handling failures and cleanup properly
- Understanding trade-offs between self-hosted and managed CI tools
