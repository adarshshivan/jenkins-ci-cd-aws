# Jenkins Local Setup

Jenkins was first run locally using Docker to validate pipeline logic without relying on cloud infrastructure.

This setup allowed:
- Faster feedback during pipeline development
- Easier debugging of scripts
- Validation of Docker socket access

Running Jenkins locally helped stabilize the pipeline before moving to AWS EC2.
