# 📖 Project Overview

This project focuses on building and comparing CI pipelines using Jenkins and GitHub Actions for a Dockerized Python application.

## Objectives

The objective was not only to automate builds and tests, but also to understand how different CI tools behave across local and cloud environments. Jenkins was set up both locally and on AWS EC2, while GitHub Actions was used as a managed CI alternative.

## Focus Areas

The project emphasizes practical DevOps skills such as pipeline design, container validation, failure handling, and CI tool comparison rather than deployment complexity.
